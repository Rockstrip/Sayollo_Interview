*RequestManager* class is responsible for create GET/POST requests. It is used by other classes. Does not inherit MonoBehaviour
*ViedoManager* class is responsible for playing and downloading the video.
*PurchaseManager* class is responsible for showing info about item and send a buy request.

I have used System.Net.Http library for networking. It is simple and async solution.
